# Subtyping_MS_and_NMOSD
Subtypeing MS and NMOSD using SustaIn 
Here we provided the main codes generated in study "Subtypes of Brain and Spinal Cord Spatiotemporal Atrophies in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders and Multiple Sclerosis". 

Details on the description of these codes are as follows:

Covariate_adjust.R is used for calculating the individual Z-scores of each metric with age- and sex- matched HCs as references and adjust for age, sex and TIV.

MS_NMO_sustain_process.py is used for SustaIn model training and testing by 10-folds corss-validation.

Other codes are used for statistical analysis and figure plot for between subtypes comparisons, clincial assocaitions, treatment response and follo-up analysis for NMOSD and MS respectively.
